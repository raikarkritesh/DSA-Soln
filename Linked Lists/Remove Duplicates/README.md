LL: Remove Duplicates ( ** Interview Question)
Implement a member function called removeDuplicates() that removes all duplicate nodes from the linked list based on their values.
Note: this linked list class does NOT have a tail which will make this method easier to implement.

Output:
The function should modify the linked list in-place, removing all nodes with duplicate values.

Constraints:
You are allowed to use the JavaScript Set data structure to keep track of unique node values.


Example 1:
Suppose you have a LinkedList object, list, with the following values:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4

After calling the removeDuplicates() function:
list.removeDuplicates();
The linked list should now have the following values: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4


Example 2:
Now suppose you have a LinkedList object, list, with the following values:
3 -> 3 -> 3

After calling the removeDuplicates() function:
list.removeDuplicates();
The linked list should now have the following value: 3


Remember to update the length.
